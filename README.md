### Notes/Assumption:

- FootballScoreboard is dedicated class for managing whole scoreboard including match start/update/finish.
- Used minimal UI representation of FootballScoreboard without using any 3rd Party.
- This application is not using any state management as I have using local collections to store scoreboard.
